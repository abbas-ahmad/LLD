Design Patterns Involved or Used:|
* ------------------------------ |

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern: The MVC pattern can be used to separate the application into three components: the model (data and business logic),
* the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user interactions and manages the flow of data).

Singleton Pattern: The Singleton pattern can be used to ensure that only one instance of certain classes, such as the user authentication manager or the order manager,
* is created and shared across the system.

Factory Pattern: The Factory pattern can be used to create different types of objects, such as users, restaurants, or menu items, based on user requests.

Observer Pattern: The Observer pattern can be used to notify users about changes in order status, such as updates on preparation, packaging, or delivery.

Decorator Pattern: The Decorator pattern can be used to add additional functionality or features, such as discounts, offers, or user preferences, to the core
* classes in the system.

Proxy Pattern: The Proxy pattern can be used to handle the communication between clients and the actual restaurant or delivery service, providing a level of
* indirection and encapsulation for network operations.
