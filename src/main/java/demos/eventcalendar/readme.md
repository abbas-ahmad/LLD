## Design Patterns Involved or Used

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: The MVC pattern can be used to separate the calendar application into three components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user interactions and manages the flow of data).

- **Observer Pattern**: The Observer pattern can be used to notify users about upcoming events and event invitations.

- **Factory Pattern**: The Factory pattern can be used to create different types of event objects based on user requests, such as one-time events or recurring events.

- **Singleton Pattern**: The Singleton pattern can be used to ensure that only one instance of certain classes, such as the event manager or the user authentication manager, is created and shared across the application.

- **Proxy Pattern**: The Proxy pattern can be used to handle communication between the application and external services, such as email servers for event reminders.

- **Command Pattern**: The Command pattern can be used to encapsulate and decouple actions, such as creating events or sending event invitations, from the specific objects or components that perform those actions.

- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: The Publish-Subscribe pattern can be used to implement the event notification system, where users subscribe to their events to receive reminders, and publishers send event reminders to the subscribers.

- **Decorator Pattern**: The Decorator pattern can be used to add additional features or behaviors to event objects, such as event categories.

- **Strategy Pattern**: The Strategy pattern can be used to implement different search algorithms for searching events based on different criteria, such as keywords or date.

- **State Pattern**: The State pattern can be used to manage the different states of event interactions, such as creating, editing, or deleting events.
